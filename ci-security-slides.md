## Survival tips

- New to DevOps?

  ⇨ Focus on learning GitHub Actions

- Completionists

  ⇨ Start with answers from `release/examples` branch

- CTF

  ⇨ Just don't check the `release/examples` branch

---slide---

## How the labs work

- Fork the repository:

  <https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security>

- Read the `/labs/*`
- Make your own solution under `/.github/workflows`
- Check example solutions from

  <https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/tree/release/examples>

---slide---

## Lab targets

- 99% of time you are targeting .NET application
- It is `dotnet new mvc` template with some small changes
- Disclaimer: Attack only targets that you have permission for.

## CI feedback loop

![Running potato](images/runner_potato.png) <!-- .element: width="400" -->

- Focus on fast feedback loop

---note---

OODA

---slide---

## Detect threats

```md [1|2|3|4]
🟢 Detect succesful (good)
🟢 Tool not run (bad)
🔴 Tool failed (bad)
🔴 Detected and failed (bad)
```

- Start from this
- Stick with this with slow tests

---note---

If the point is to detect and not prevent, then build failures are soon to be dismissed if they by default always fail.

---slide---

## Prevent threats

```md [1|2|3|4]
🟢 No threats (good)
🔴 Prevention successful (good)
🔴 Tool failed (bad)
🟢 Tool not run (bad)
```

- Requires high security maturity

---note---

False positive, false negative, true positive, true negative etc.

---page---

## GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions are based on YAML.
- `.yml`-files needs to be in `.github/workflows` in `main` branch
- You can run different version of a workflow from other branch
- Lab00-Lab02: Teaches the syntax GitHub Actions syntax

---slide---

## GitHub-hosted runners

- Run on "somebody elses VMs"
- Running on Windows / Mac images consumes more time
- Lab00-Lab02: Teaches the syntax GitHub Actions syntax

---slide---

```yaml [1-2|3-6|8-9|11-12]
name: Name shown in github
run-name: Run name shown in github
on: # Starting triggers
  workflow_dispatch: # Click from GitHub support
  pull_request: # After PR is created
  push: # After commit is pushed
jobs:
  Example-Job: # Set of steps that are run on a VM
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # type of vm
    steps:
      - name: Example # name of step
        run: echo "🎉!" # Actually doing the thing
```

---slide---

## Security considerations

- Examples are using 3rd party actions
- Examples are using 3rd party tools
- These are RCE-vector to your IPR (code)

---slide---

## Recap

- [Lab00: Hello](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab00-hello-github-actions.yml)
- [Lab01: Variables and secrets](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab01-variables-and-secrets.yml)
- [Lab02: Reuse and artifacts](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab02-reuse-and-artifacts.yml)

---note---

- Lab00: Just print something
- Lab01: Check variable printing and masking of data
- Lab02: Check publish artifact part and output

---page---

## Dependencies

![Pointing potato](images/pointing_potato.jpeg) <!-- .element: width="400" -->

---note---

Somebody elses fault

---slide---

### These labs focus on different threats about software dependencies

- Lab10: Detect known vulnerabilities (SCA)
- Lab11: Learn to control how transient dependencies are resolved
- Lab12: Detect problematic licenses in dependencies
- Lab13: Generate Software Bill of Materials

---note---

Recap at 1:00

---slide---

## Recap

- [Lab10: SCA](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab10-software-composition-analysis.yml)
- [Lab11: Package locks](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab11-create-package-lock.yml)
- [Lab12: License check](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab12-license-check.yml)
- [Lab13: SBOM](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/.github/workflows/lab13-sbom.yml)

---note---

Recap: 1:00

- Lab10: System.Text.Json vuln and jquery vuln
- Lab11: Nothing fancy, transient dependencies are just resolved awkwardly. Dotnet by default resolves lowest possible version of a package ... which is awkward.
- Lab12: AGPL and also that scancode actually scans your files, not just the metadata
- Lab13: Nothing special, just check the output

## Development

![Sad potato](images/sad_potato.jpeg) <!-- .element: width="400" -->

---slide---

### These labs focus on different threats during software development

- Lab20: Learn to protect important branches
- Lab21: Learn to find vulnerabilities in your code (SAST)
- Lab22: Learn to find secrets from git repositories

---slide---

## Recap

- [Lab20: Branch protections](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/scripts/branchprotections.ps1)
